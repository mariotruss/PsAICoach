# PsAICoach

Psy-Coach is an AI-inspired mental health companion prototype that demonstrates core experiences described in the original product brief. The web demo showcases conversational support, CBT tools, reality validation guidance, journaling, and a therapist insights dashboard using scripted responses and mock data.

## Getting started

The prototype is a static web experience. You can open it directly or serve it locally.

### Option 1: Open directly

1. Open `web/index.html` in your browser.

### Option 2: Serve locally (recommended for development)

1. From the repository root, run a lightweight HTTP server, for example:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 5173
   ```
2. Visit [http://localhost:5173/web/](http://localhost:5173/web/) in your browser.
