## 🧠 Understanding AR Reality Validation

### How It Works
The AR overlay provides three types of grounding:

1. **Spatial grounding**: Grid helps you see physical space clearly
2. **Temporal grounding**: Timestamp confirms "now" (not past/future)
3. **Visual evidence**: Captured image shows objective reality

### When to Use It
- Uncertain if something/someone is really there
- Paranoid thoughts about being followed
- Visual distortions or hallucinations
- Feeling like reality is "off" or distorted
- Need evidence to review later

### What the AR Shows
- **Grid pattern**: 50px spacing for spatial reference
- **Timestamp**: Current date and time
- **"PsAICoSys Reality Check"**: Indicator at top
- **All embedded in capture**: Can't be edited later
