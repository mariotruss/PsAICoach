## 🔬 AR Reality Validation

### How It Works
1. Tap the 🎥 video button when something feels uncertain

   - "Reality Check Active" indicator
3. Capture the moment
4. Review the image—does it match what you perceived?
5. Share with your companion for support

### Why It Helps
For users experiencing psychosis or dissociation:
- **Visual grounding**: Grid provides spatial reference
- **Temporal grounding**: Timestamp confirms "now"
- **Evidence**: Captures can be reviewed later or shared with therapists
- **Validation**: Helps distinguish real from unreal perceptions
- **Empowerment**: Self-guided reality testing tool

## 📱 Navigation

1. **💬 Chat**: Main conversation view (always central)
2. **📝 Journal**: Daily reflections and mood tracking
3. **🧩 Tools**: Reality check, grounding, CBT exercises

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

### "Companion, Not App"
The interface is designed to feel like you have a supportive presence with you at all times, not just another app you open when things are bad.

### "Capture Now, Process Later"
The focus is on making it extremely easy to capture what you're experiencing in the moment—through voice, photo, or AR video—so you can process it when you're ready.

### "Reality Validation Through Technology"
AR isn't just a gimmick—it's a therapeutic tool that provides visual and temporal grounding, helping users distinguish real from unreal perceptions.

### "Engaging, Not Clinical"
Mental health support doesn't have to look like a medical device. The app is warm, colorful, animated, and fun to use while remaining respectful and empathetic.

## 🔮 Future Possibilities

- Social validation: Multi-user reality checks

- Medication reminders
- Guided meditations with haptic feedback
