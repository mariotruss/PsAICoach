# Rebranding: PsyCoach → PsAICoSys

## New Name: PsAICoSys
**Pronunciation**: "Sai-Co-Sis" (like "Psychosis" but with AI emphasized)

**Meaning**: 
- **PsAI** = Psychosis + AI
- **Co** = Companion/Cognitive
- **Sys** = System

This name clearly positions the app as an **AI system specifically designed for psychosis and schizophrenia**.

## Branding Changes

### Positioning
- **Before**: General mental health companion
- **After**: Specialized AI support for psychosis, schizophrenia, and psychotic experiences

### Messaging
- **Focus**: Reality validation, AR-assisted grounding, psychosis-specific support
- **Target Users**: People experiencing psychosis, schizophrenia, or dissociative symptoms
- **Key Differentiator**: AR reality checking specifically designed for validating perceptions

### Updated Locations
1. **Landing Page** (`web/landing.html`)
   - Title: "PsAICoSys - AI Support for Psychosis & Schizophrenia"
   - Hero: Emphasizes psychosis management
   - Use cases: Focused on psychotic experiences
   - AR section: Specifically for distinguishing real vs unreal perceptions

2. **Main App** (`web/index.html`)
   - Header shows "PsAICoSys"
   - Status text: "Reality validation & support"
   
3. **App Logic** (`web/app.js`)
   - Welcome message mentions psychosis support
   - Image capture focuses on reality validation
   - AR overlay shows "PsAICoSys Reality Check"

### Design Implications

The rebranding makes the app's purpose immediately clear:
- **Medical focus**: Psychosis, not general anxiety/depression
- **Therapeutic tool**: AR for reality testing
- **Specialized support**: Features designed for this specific condition

### Disclaimers Updated
Footer now states:
> "AI Support System for Psychosis & Schizophrenia (Prototype)"
> "Does not replace professional psychiatric care or medication"

## Marketing Angle

PsAICoSys positions itself as:
1. **Specialized**: Not another general mental health app
2. **Innovative**: Uses AR technology therapeutically
3. **Evidence-based**: Reality checking, CBT, grounding techniques
4. **Empowering**: Self-guided reality validation between therapy sessions

## Next Steps

Additional files that may need updating:
- README.md (update title and description)
- FEATURES.md (update branding)
- COMPANION_REDESIGN.md (update name throughout)
- Voice interface files (if keeping that version)
- Module comments and documentation

The core rebranding is complete in the main user-facing pages (landing, app).
